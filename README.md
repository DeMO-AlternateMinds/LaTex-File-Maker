# LatexTemplate
This is to create a latex file that contains a certain number of sections. 

Requires Python

## How to use?
Currently, you will have to copy and paste the python file to the active directory as I have not optimized it. Once you move it, you just follow the prompts.

There is an option called 'a' that can be used to make subsections. 

Note: Please look at issue 'Need to update instructions' #8 

Also when loading a file, you should first make a backup. You must have <|> on its own line in order for it to insert properly.


## Purpose
I am using this for my classes. I like using Latex, but I have to keep typing the same thing over and over again or make subsections that are just incrementing numbers

## Sources
While I do have experience with python, I do not remember all the syntax or concepts of the language, so I do use sources that are not primary knowledge to myself. While if it is a syntax information, the source will not be posted, if it is conceptual information, external tutorials , or code snippets, and the like, there will be have a link to it. This typically be done in the instance that it is mentioned in.  

## Why Unlicensed?
