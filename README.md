# LatexTemplate
This is to create a latex file that contains a certain number of sections. 

## How to use?
Currently, you will have to copy and paste the python file to the active directory as I have not optimized it. Once you move it, you just follow the prompts.

There is an option called 'a' that can be used to make subsections. 

Note: Please look at issue 'Need to update instructions' #8 


## Purpose
I am using this for my classes. I like using Latex, but I have to keep typing the same thing over and over again or make subsections that are just incrementing numbers.
